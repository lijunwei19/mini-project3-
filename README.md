react vs ios

## Codebase
React Native enables a single JavaScript codebase;
ios enables swift;

### For Swift Process
Learning Swift was more easier, it is similiar with java and c++. However, the ios framework is much harder. on the other hand, Apple's IDE (Xcode) is very advance and userfriendly. 

### for React_Native Process
language JavaScript was harder than swift. however, the framwork is much easier and you can use your code in Andrio, web and iso. Many companys want to publish thier apps both in Andrio and ios store. they do not need to program thier project twice times. just compiler to different operation system. also you can reuse code effectively.
